The "FileOps-GoServer" repository houses the core Go-based HTTP server designed to streamline file management operations, including uploading, downloading, and deleting files. Leveraging Go's robust built-in packages for file I/O and concurrency management, this project ensures optimal efficiency and performance. Developed with a focus on asynchronicity, the server employs Goroutines to handle multiple file operations simultaneously, providing a scalable and responsive API service for file operations. This repository serves as a foundational platform for developers seeking to integrate advanced file handling capabilities into their applications using Go's powerful and lightweight framework.
